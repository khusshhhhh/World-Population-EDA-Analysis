# World-Population-EDA-Analysis

**Introduction**
The world's population has seen significant shifts and changes over the past few decades. Understanding these trends can provide insights into economic growth, resource allocation, urbanization, and societal changes. The world_population.csv dataset offers a comprehensive view of population metrics for various countries spanning from 1970 to 2022. This report delves into the data to uncover patterns, growth rates, and other key insights.

**Data Processing**
Data Overview:
The dataset contains several columns, including:

Country name and code
Capital
Continent
Population for various years (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2022)
Area (in km²)
Population Density (per km²)
Growth Rate
World Population Percentage
Data Cleaning:
Initial examination of the data did not indicate any missing or inconsistent entries. However, for a thorough analysis, it would be prudent to check for any anomalies or outliers that could skew the results.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Growth Rate Analysis:
Understanding the countries with the highest and lowest growth rates can help identify economic or societal factors influencing these rates.
Population Density:
By analyzing the ratio of population to land area, we can infer urbanization trends and potential resource constraints.
Continent-wise Population Distribution:
Grouping data by continents will offer a macro-level view of population distribution and growth patterns.
Historical Population Trends:
Examining the population from 1970 to 2022 can offer insights into long-term trends and potential future trajectories.
